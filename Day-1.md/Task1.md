Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2.
HTTP/1.1 :
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol,   
Year - HTTP/1.1 introduced in 1997,
The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.
1. Protocol Foundation:
HTTP/1.1 has been used for the  world wide web for more than "two decades".
It relies on a text based format for communication and uses a single connection for each request-response cycle.
2. Binary Protocol:
Communication in HTTP/1.1 is done through plaintext, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and security vulnerabilities.
3. Server Push:
In the traditional model, the server can only respond to client requests. Any additional resources required by the client must be explicitly requested.


HTTP2:
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
Year - HTTP/2 introduced in 2015,
A new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
1. Protocol Foundation:
HTTP/2 was developed to address the limitations of its predecessor. It brought fundamental changes to the way data is transmitted over the web, introducing a binary protocol for more efficient communication.
2. Binary Protocol:
The binary format of HTTP/2 not only improves efficiency but also enhances security by preventing casual eavesdropping. It ensures a more secure environment for data transmission.
3. Server Push:
Server push is a game-changer. It allows the server to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested, reducing the need for additional round trips and further optimizing performance.
